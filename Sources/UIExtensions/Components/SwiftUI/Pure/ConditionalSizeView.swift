/// desired.
/// It provides a list of diferent View States that will differ according to the available size given by the parent
/// The best option for View State will be anything that fits in the parent's frame, and also enforcing aspect is
/// available in case only horizontal views are allowed in horizontal parents, and only vertical views are allowed
/// in vertical parents.
/// Otherwise, anything that fits both dimensions - regardles of aspect - will be chosen, having priority those with
/// more pixels and less priority those with fewer pixels. If pixel count is the same, aspect decides. Hashable ensure
/// that you can't have 2 options with exact same height and width.
